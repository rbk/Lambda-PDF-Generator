# README.md

This repository hosts the code and content for an article I wrote about creating a PDF generator with AWS Lambda and WKHTMLtoPDF.

## How to get this running

1. Have AWS Cli installed and configured (You must have access keys that can use Lambda and S3)
1. `cd project_root`
1. Change the name of `config.sample.yml` to `config.yml`
1. Set the name of your S3 bucket in the `config.yml`
1. `serverless deploy`
